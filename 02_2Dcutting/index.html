<b>Problem:</b> Over the course of the pandemic, I became a plant parent. In 2019, our home had zero houseplants. By the end of 2020, we accumulated over 18 plants. As our travel schedule resumed both for business and pleasure, we are faced with the reality of how we will care for these new living beings. 
<br>

While this challenge started as a personal one, preliminary research findings indicate it may be a wide-spread problem. 
<br>

Data Bridge Market Research the global indoor plants market is expected to reach $26.63B by 2029, a 4.87% CAGR from 2021 levels of $17.93B (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/indoor-plants-market-to-register-promising-growth-of-usd-26-23-billion-by-2029--size-share-growth-opportunities-trade-insights-and-competitive-landscape-301655694.html).The demographics of plant owners are also changing with the majority of the growth from younger consumers. According to Garden Center Magazine, the biggest demographic growth in demand for houseplants was from millennials at 65%. This was followed by gen Z at 44% and gen X at 33% (source: https://terrariumtribe.com/houseplant-statistics/#hp1).
