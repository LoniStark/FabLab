<b>Problem:</b> Over the course of the pandemic, I became a plant parent. In 2019, our home had zero houseplants. By the end of 2020, we accumulated over 18 plants. As our travel schedule resumed both for business and pleasure, we are faced with the reality of how we will care for these new living beings. 
<br>

While this challenge started as a personal one, preliminary research findings indicate it may be a wide-spread problem. 
<br>

Data Bridge Market Research the global indoor plants market is expected to reach $26.63B by 2029, a 4.87% CAGR from 2021 levels of $17.93B (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/indoor-plants-market-to-register-promising-growth-of-usd-26-23-billion-by-2029--size-share-growth-opportunities-trade-insights-and-competitive-landscape-301655694.html).The demographics of plant owners are also changing with the majority of the growth from younger consumers. According to Garden Center Magazine, the biggest demographic growth in demand for houseplants was from millennials at 65%. This was followed by gen Z at 44% and gen X at 33% (source: https://terrariumtribe.com/houseplant-statistics/#hp1). 
<br>
 
Furthermore, it seems to be an issue that people will pay to solve. For example, on taskrabbit, there are listings for vacation plant water services (https://www.taskrabbit.com/services/yardwork-removal/vacation-plant-watering). According to plantcian, plant-sitters can charge between $10-50 a day beyond the challenge of finding a human plant sitter whom you trust and has a green thumb (https://www.plantician.com/how-much-to-pay-someone-to-water-plants/). Some caution here is that the two sites referenced, The Plant Sitters in Seattle and Plants and Ponytails based in Hanover, MA both have websites that are not operational anymore. Another company, Watering Can (https://www.wateringcanapp.com/) provides an app in an "uber-like" manner to find plant sitters. 
<br>

Finally, having house plants has been shown in studies to improve focus, well-being and improve air quality.
<br>

Why can't house plant care be more automated like irrigation for your backyard. Especially in metropolitan areas. 

<b>Idea:</b> Build an indoor houseplant care and monitoring solution that enables passionate plant parents a way to monitor their green babies while they are out on vacation or travelling for business. 
<br>

<b>Considerations:</b> Factors to consider in the design and scope of the solution.

1. How many plants should one Plant Sitter be able to take care? 1 to many. Should it enable variable number of plants?
66% of American households own 1 or more plants (https://gardenpals.com/houseplant-statistics/). This concurs with another source that also noted 25% of survey respondants own 2-5 houseplants, and 12% own more than six (https://justhouseplants.com/houseplant-statistics/#1). There are also self-watering planters so if only one planter, this type of solution may be more optimal. 

2. Average length of vacation?

3. Watering (essential): Should it be variable based on soil sensor or set timing and quantity? Also different levels of soil moisture, is this determined by Plant Sitter or the parent? 

4. Will it support plants on the floor, table and/or hanging?

5. Video monitoring of plant? Is this needed and useful? Like baby monitors?

6. Does the Plant Sitter go to the plant or do the plants have to moved to the Plant Sitter?

7. Will there be the ability to control any of the features and functions of Plant Sitter remotely through a mobile app?

<b>Current Solutions</b>

Interestingly, unlike in previous years when I researched this topic, I have found there are options in the market nicely summarized by Electronics Hub here (https://www.electronicshub.org/best-automatic-watering-system-for-indoor-plants/) This means it has been identified as a problem and there are solutions in the market. Will need to  evaluate these and see what could be an unmet need in these solutions. 

Most of these systems are around $36-$50. 

Kollea Plant Watering System, Automatic Drip Irrigation Kit

This solution includes a pump with in/out that connects to a water tank. Irrigation tubing and spikes connect to a set of plants. To change amount of water (10-990 ml) and time button to set amount of watering time and interval. It is powered by a battery that lasts 60 days. Battery is used so it can be placed anywhere with a hook for hte main device. 


Raindrip R560DP Automatic Watering Kit for Container and Hanging Plants. While it is noted this is for indoors, the actual video for this product shows it is for outdoor use, requiring connections like a hose bib.

Moistland Drip Watering System for Indoor Plants

Similar to the Kollea this system has a controller which enables watering time form 5-15 mins and supports 10-15 plants. Battery powered. Uses a drip irrigation system.
