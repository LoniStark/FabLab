Problem: Over the course of the pandemic, I became a plant parent. In 2019, our home had zero houseplants. By the end of 2020, we accumulated over 18 plants. As our travel schedule resumed both for business and pleasure, we are faced with the reality of how we will care for these new living beings. 
<br>

While this challenge started as a personal one, preliminary research findings indicate it may be a wide-spread problem. 
<br>

Data Bridge Market Research the global indoor plants market is expected to reach $26.63B by 2029, a 4.87% CAGR from 2021 levels of $17.93B (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/indoor-plants-market-to-register-promising-growth-of-usd-26-23-billion-by-2029--size-share-growth-opportunities-trade-insights-and-competitive-landscape-301655694.html).The demographics of plant owners are also changing with the majority of the growth from younger consumers. According to Garden Center Magazine, the biggest demographic growth in demand for houseplants was from millennials at 65%. This was followed by gen Z at 44% and gen X at 33% (source: https://terrariumtribe.com/houseplant-statistics/#hp1). 
<br>
 
Furthermore, it seems to be an issue that people will pay to solve. For example, on taskrabbit, there are listings for vacation plant water services (https://www.taskrabbit.com/services/yardwork-removal/vacation-plant-watering). According to plantcian, plant-sitters can charge between $10-50 a day beyond the challenge of finding a human plant sitter whom you trust and has a green thumb (https://www.plantician.com/how-much-to-pay-someone-to-water-plants/). Some caution here is that the two sites referenced, The Plant Sitters in Seattle and Plants and Ponytails based in Hanover, MA both have websites that are not operational anymore. Another company, Watering Can (https://www.wateringcanapp.com/) provides an app in an "uber-like" manner to find plant sitters. 
<br>

Finally, having house plants has been shown in studies to improve focus, well-being and improve air quality.

<br>
Why can't house plant care be more automated like irrigation for your backyard. Especially in metropolitan areas. 

<br>

Proposal: Build an indoor houseplant watering system that enables passionate plant parents a way to monitor their green babies while they are out on vacation or travelling for business.
