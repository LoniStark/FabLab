#### Possibilities

Three ideas in exploration are: Plant Sitter, Cat's Cradle Robotic Arm and Sky Roof Transformer. 

#####Plant Sitter

<b>Problem:</b> Over the course of the pandemic, I became a plant parent. In 2019, our home had zero houseplants. By the end of 2020, we accumulated over 18 plants. As our travel schedule resumed both for business and pleasure, we are faced with the reality of how we will care for these new living beings. 
<br>

While this challenge started as a personal one, preliminary research findings indicate it may be a wide-spread problem. 
<br>

Data Bridge Market Research the global indoor plants market is expected to reach $26.63B by 2029, a 4.87% CAGR from 2021 levels of $17.93B (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/indoor-plants-market-to-register-promising-growth-of-usd-26-23-billion-by-2029--size-share-growth-opportunities-trade-insights-and-competitive-landscape-301655694.html).The demographics of plant owners are also changing with the majority of the growth from younger consumers. According to Garden Center Magazine, the biggest demographic growth in demand for houseplants was from millennials at 65%. This was followed by gen Z at 44% and gen X at 33% (source: https://terrariumtribe.com/houseplant-statistics/#hp1). 
<br>
 
Furthermore, it seems to be an issue that people will pay to solve. For example, on taskrabbit, there are listings for vacation plant water services (https://www.taskrabbit.com/services/yardwork-removal/vacation-plant-watering). According to plantcian, plant-sitters can charge between $10-50 a day beyond the challenge of finding a human plant sitter whom you trust and has a green thumb (https://www.plantician.com/how-much-to-pay-someone-to-water-plants/). Some caution here is that the two sites referenced, The Plant Sitters in Seattle and Plants and Ponytails based in Hanover, MA both have websites that are not operational anymore. Another company, Watering Can (https://www.wateringcanapp.com/) provides an app in an "uber-like" manner to find plant sitters. 
<br>

Finally, having house plants has been shown in studies to improve focus, well-being and improve air quality.
<br>

Why can't house plant care be more automated like irrigation for your backyard. Especially in metropolitan areas. 

<b>Idea:</b> Build an indoor houseplant care and monitoring solution that enables passionate plant parents a way to monitor and care for their green babies while they are out on vacation or travelling for business. 
<br>

<b>Considerations:</b> Factors to consider in the design and scope of the solution.

1. How many plants should one Plant Sitter be able to take care? 1 to many. Should it enable variable number of plants?
66% of American households own 1 or more plants (https://gardenpals.com/houseplant-statistics/). This concurs with another source that also noted 25% of survey respondants own 2-5 houseplants, and 12% own more than six (https://justhouseplants.com/houseplant-statistics/#1). There are also self-watering planters so if only one planter, this type of solution may be more optimal. 

2. Average length of vacation?

3. Watering (essential): Should it be variable based on soil sensor or set timing and quantity? Also different levels of soil moisture, is this determined by Plant Sitter or the parent? 

4. Will it support plants on the floor, table and/or hanging?

5. Video monitoring of plant? Is this needed and useful? Like baby monitors?

6. Does the Plant Sitter go to the plant or do the plants have to moved to the Plant Sitter?

7. Will there be the ability to control any of the features and functions of Plant Sitter remotely through a mobile app?

<b>Current Solutions</b>

Interestingly, unlike in previous years when I researched this topic, I have found there are options in the market nicely summarized by Electronics Hub here (https://www.electronicshub.org/best-automatic-watering-system-for-indoor-plants/) This means it has been identified as a problem and there are solutions in the market. Will need to  evaluate these and see what could be an unmet need in these solutions. 

Most of these systems are around $36-$50. 

<b>Kollea Plant Watering System, Automatic Drip Irrigation Kit:</b> This solution includes a pump with in/out that connects to a water tank. Irrigation tubing and spikes connect to a set of plants. To change amount of water (10-990 ml) and time button to set amount of watering time and interval. It is powered by a battery that lasts 60 days. Battery is used so it can be placed anywhere with a hook for hte main device. 


<b>Raindrip R560DP Automatic Watering Kit for Container and Hanging Plants</b>: While it is noted this is for indoors, the actual video for this product shows it is for outdoor use, requiring connections like a hose bib.

<b>Moistland Drip Watering System for Indoor Plants:</b> Similar to the Kollea this system has a controller which enables watering time form 5-15 mins and supports 10-15 plants. Battery powered. Uses a drip irrigation system. 

Most of the DIY solutions I found were focused on larger indoor plants for food and medicinal purposes. These were very low tech solutions involving usually an outdoor timer and irrigation hoses.

<b>Potential Issues with Current Solutions</b>

The current solutions in the market all approach it with: pump wtih timer, tubes for drip irrigation and intefaces that require the user to set time intervals for watering. These solutions are like life support for plants, but they are not truly caring for optimal plant health. 

Some challenges with current approaches:

- Depending on the temperature and humidity, house plant watering needs can be vary greatly. Setting regular intervals can lead to over or under watering.
- Input interfaces can be hard to use or error-prone on actual programming.
- Drip irrigation system leads to all plants getting about the same amount of water whereas some house plant types need more water and others less based on species and size of plants.
- Lack of trust in the system. No feedback mechanism means a plant parent is always anxious to get back to ensure their plant babies are okay.

#####Cat's Cradle
<div class="main">

Cat's Cradle is a sculpture I am working on as we think about our own humanity in the face of the advances in artificial intelligence and robotics. 

The sculpture is being built using plastalene and will be cast in bronze. The current robotic arm is one I purchased from Amazon as a kit. While I considered the idea of a ready-made, I think it would be a more fully formed execution of the vision if I built the robotic arm to perhaps reach down and pull on the string. 
<br>

The next few images are of my latest sketches of the concept.

These are preliminary ideas about the display of the piece.

#####Sky Roof Transformer

<div class="main">

</div>

<b>Problem:</b> I recently designed a polycarbonate roof to extend my home art studio into the courtyard space, taking advantage of natural light with a clear roof. For a good part of the day, there is appropriate indirect light source. However, there are times of the day when either the sun is directly shining through or it is too dark to paint. I'd like to have a lighting and shading system that is as discrete as possible and provides the right shade and lighting needed at the right places for my painting and art making needs.

<b>Potential Solutions:</b> There are advances in glass and LED lighting technology that may make it possible to create a motorized glass panel system that allows for glass to become LED lighting or blinds based on whether light or shade is needed, thus transforming the roof into its own sky with lights and clouds. 

I found a few links and resources to technology such as Smart Glass and Polymagic LED Glass (https://polytronixglass.com/products/polymagic/), but they seem to be focused more on commercial uses and expensive.
