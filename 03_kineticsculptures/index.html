### Kinetic Sculpture

<h3>Catching and Executing on the Big Idea</h3>

During the 2D cutting project, I had stumbled across Cabaret Mechanical Theatre (https://cabaret.co.uk/) and was delighted by the whimsical kinetic sculptures. It was wonderful during our labs to get to play with their Automata Tinkering Kits. 

For my kinetic sculpture, I was torn between a more narrative and whimsical piece versus an abstract sculpture. In the end, I decided I would find it personally more compelling to try to figure out how to construct a whimsical piece. 


  <img src="01_Kinetic_EarlySketches_Stark_Jun28.jpg" class="photo" alt="Rough sketch for idea of kinetic sculpture.">
  <figcaption>I started to sketch out some ideas of what I wanted my kinetic sculpture to look like. For me, it is important for there to be a concept behind my work, even if it may not be explicitly noted. </figcaption>


  <img src="02_Kinetic_Different_Movement_Stark_Jun28.jpg" class="photo" alt="Motions for different types of mechanisms.">
  <figcaption>I then started to break down the different mechanical movements that were part of the Automata Tinkering Kits. I figured this would hlep me understand the types of movement I could put into a sculpture. The sculpture I have done in the past had static armatures, whereas this one would need to move. I realized that this additional dimension of time to an otherwise 3D exercise is very hard to do well.</figcaption>

  <img src="03_Kinetic_Sketch_Stark_Jun28.jpg" class="photo" alt="Initial sketches of ideas for the mechanical part of kinetic sculpture.">
  <figcaption>Based on the prior two sketches, I tried to construct the mechanisms that would give me the desired motion in my automaton. I had not spent much time figuring out what I wanted the piece to look like since I had more confidence in the artistic part and because it was too complex to keep both components in my head.</figcaption>

  <img src="04_Kinetic_SketchGears_Stark_Jun28.jpg" class="photo" alt="Another iteration of the mechanism.">
  <figcaption>Another iteration of the mechanism, this time with a break down of the possible components I would need. In this version, I had used a pulley system to power two rotating shafts that would drive movement in the sculpture. </figcaption>

 
  <img src="06_Kinetic_Cardboard_Stark_Jun29.jpg" class="photo" alt="Kinetic armature of my sculpture.">
  <figcaption>I printed out a set of cardboard cams to play with. I made the silly mistake of not thinking more specifically about proportions and made some pretty large pieces. I had wanted to print a set of them in varying sizes; should have constrained the range and decreased the intervals.</figcaption>

  <img src="07_Kinetic_WoodToy__Stark_Jun29.jpg" class="photo" alt="Back of kinetic armature.">
  <figcaption>It was challenging to work out the mechanisms without a place to put the pieces on, so I went back to playing with the Automata Tinkering Kit to model out what my sketches would look like. I also reconsidered the pulley design. Since it required the friction of the wheels, it was not going to be as predictable as gears. I decided to switch to gears. This image is of the "front" of my kinetic structure; the "armature".</figcaption>

  <img src="08_Kinetic_ToyProto_Stark_Jun29.jpg" class="photo" alt="Side view of kinetic armature.">
  <figcaption>This is the back side. There were not large enough gears in the set to model what I wanted. However, I was able to turn the two pieces counter clockwise to see them in action. I also thought about "stacking" up different cams and devices to create more layered mechanisms.</figcaption>

  <img src="08.5_Kinetic_ToyProto_Stark_Jun29.jpg" class="photo" alt="Initial sketch of Catching the Big Idea">
  <figcaption>This layering in the side view I realized was going to be hard and given it is not something I had experience with, I had no great mental model.</figcaption>

  <img src="09_KineticSketchArt_Stark_Jun29.jpg" class="photo" alt="Refined sketch of the idea.">
  <figcaption>That evening, I went home with a clearer view of the "armature" and spent the evening sketching possible ideas for the sculpture. I started with the concept of a bicycle, but thought it was too small of a jump from the circling gears. Also, given the gear mechnism, the two wheels would be going in the opposite direction - maybe a comical bicycle! Finally I settled on this concept of "catching the big idea". </figcaption>

  <img src="10_KineticSketchRefine_Stark_Jun30.jpg" class="photo" alt="Digital skin of automaton.">
  <figcaption>The next morning, fresh from some sleep, I refined the sketch.</figcaption>

  <img src="11_Kinetic_DigitalDrawing_Stark_Jun30.jpg" class="photo" alt="Back gears.">
  <figcaption>I took the graphite sketch onto my iPad and used Adobe Fresco to sketch out the "skin" of this kinetic sculpture. This is one possible version that is painted. However, I could also execute it with engraving...or mix the two methods. We will see. The result gave me more ideas including how the large gear in the back could also have fish swimming around. The vision for the automaton was getting clearer, and now I figured I needed to get back to the mechanics.</figcaption>

  <img src="12_KineticDrawingBack_Stark_Jun30.jpg" class="photo" alt="CAD of gears">
  <figcaption>The back sketch of the sculpture with estimate of the actual gears. I decided that the size I drew the sketch would be 1:1 to actual sculpture. Around this time I also stumbled upon Paul Spooners' sketches as part of his virtual exhibition here: https://cabaret.co.uk/exhibitions/virtual-exhibitions/paul-spooners-virtual-exhibition/sketchbook/. It was facinating seeing all of his process ahead of creating a sculpture.</figcaption>

  <img src="CAD_Gears_Stark_July1.png" class="photo" alt="fill with caption">
  <figcaption>I used the SpurGear plugin to create the gears. I had to do a few trial and error using cardboard to get the right size teeth on the gears. Based on my sketches, I knew the diameter I needed for each gear. Once I had what I wanted in cardboard, I printed it out on 6 mm wood since I knew it would be hard to mimic the gears out of cardboard for the turning.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>Wooden gears that were 2D cut. 1:1 scale to my drawing. </figcaption>

  <img src="15_KineticCardboardProto_Jun30_Stark.jpg" class="photo" alt="First cardboard prototype.">
  <figcaption>First cardboard prototype of the sculpture. From building this, I found some of the challenges with my design based on the layering of the gears and parts. Yes, it was late at night and I decided to use my ruler for part of it. I also didn't have access to the 2D cutter that was in the lab so I had to improvise on how accurate each part of the prototype was. However, it was a valuable exercise to identify some of the design flaws. I also realized the weight of each part was going to also impact its movement. </figcaption>

  <img src="18_Kinetic_Engine_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Cardboard prototype two base.">
  <figcaption>The next morning, I decided to build another iteration of the cardboard prototype. This time, I changed the based to allow for the motor as originally conceived. It would sit inside of the sculpture. </figcaption>

  <img src="19_Stark_CatchBigIdea_Proto2_Top_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Side view of cardboard prototype 2.">
  <figcaption>In this prototype, I became more mindful of the design of the different layers of cams, gears and parts I would make out of wood versus polycarbonate.</figcaption>

  <img src="20_Kinetic_CardboardPerson_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Fisher Person">
  <figcaption>Fisher person, just because I thought it looked cut. Also because it made me think about how 3D I wanted to make the fisher person in the paper boat.</figcaption>

  <img src="21_Kinetic_CardboardProto_Progress_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Cardboard prototype in progress">
  <figcaption>Midway through the process of building out the second cardboard prototype. Based on this prototype, started to rethink the design of the way the water and fish would move and how each part of it visually laid over one another. This element of feasibility of gear layers is not something I have had to consider in software engineering or art practice to date.</figcaption>

  <img src="22_Kinetic_CatchBigIdea_Proto_v2_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Completed cardboard prototype two.">
  <figcaption>This second prototype provided me with additional learnings on this project and made me appreciate the complexity of some of the design consideration with different parts moving. It is still not possible to test out some of the mechanisms as I did not have wires and was not yet using the square dowel for ensuring the pieces spun around. I will do this once I draw out the CAD and print all the pieces on a 2D cutter. It is challenging to get to the level of fidelity needed with just a pair of scissors and masking tape.</figcaption>

  <img src="23_Kinetic_CatchBigIdea_Proto2_Back_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Back view of sculpture.">
  <figcaption>I do like kinetic sculptures that have at least all 5 out of the 6 sides to look at. I will need to consider something for hte back, but for now I will constrain my sculpture to the front view. But the notion that my sculpture reads more like a painting or film than a true sculpture is bothering me a bit...</figcaption>

  <figcaption>Demo of the movement in cardboard prototype 3.</figcaption>

  <img src="24_Kinetic_CatchBigIdea_Proto2_BackwWheel_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Back view with additional gears.">
  <figcaption>I did play around a bit with how the proportions of the back can be altered with layering.</figcaption>

  <img src="25_Kinetic_TopCardboardProto02_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Top of sculpture">
  <figcaption>As I look at the sculpture from above to examine the layers, I came to the realization that perhaps the cams should sit between to two larger pieces and it would also bring greater stability to the design. It could also change my sculpture to give it a more overall feel. I need to think through this more and perhaps be a second phase as I sense a bit of scope creep set in...</figcaption>

<img src="26_Kinetic_SideLayerOrder_Stark_July1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Top of sculpture">
  <figcaption>Spent some time thinking about the mechanical design of the sculpture. Decided it was better to hae the cams between the two polycarbonate pieces. Also widened it and put some structure around the shafts to stablize them more.</figcaption>

<img src="27_Kinetic_CardboardPrototype5_Stark_July3.jpg" class="photo" alt="Top of sculpture">
  <figcaption>Spent the morning cleaning up what I did last night so that I would be ready to go into the labs and build the parts with the 2D cutter.</figcaption>
</div>

<img src="28_Kinetic_2DCutCams_Stark_July3.jpg" class="photo" alt="Top of sculpture">
  <figcaption>Wow, what a difference having a 2D laser cutter get the precision needed. Also much faster!</figcaption>
</div>

<img src="29_Kinetic_2DCutStructure_Stark_July3.jpg" class="photo" alt="Top of sculpture">
  <figcaption>2D cut the base so that I had a solid structure to build this fifth cardboard prototype. I will want to change it, but for now, it helps to hold the wood rods in place for all my gears and cams.</figcaption>
