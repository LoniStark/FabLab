<div class="bio">

  <p>Thomas Edison once said, "Vision without execution is hallucination."</p>

  <p>... and the creation of art, utilitarian stuff, and the self necessitates both. I'm drawn towards the exploration of ideas and patterns between seemingly unrelated areas in pursuit of new possibilities. </p>

  <p>As a student, I am pursuing a Masters at Harvard Extension School in psychology and exploring a life-long fascination in self-aspect creation as a pathway to greater self-complexity and wellness. As an artist, my interest mainly lies in figurative oil paintings that explore the human psyche rather than surface aesthetics. As a product leader, I endeavor to build innovative solutions to problems. </p>

  <p>I believe that achieving mastery is not a linear process but a continual cycle between control and chaos. </p>
