### 3D Scanning and Printing
<br>

<h4>My Ear: Scanning</h4>


Given my foray into figurative sculptures, I thought it would be interesting to model my own ear in plastiline and then 3D scan and print it. Thought it would be a nod to Van Gogh in a way. 

I was also curious to see how accurately 3D scanning and printing can be in replicating an original sculpture made of something like plaster, clay or plastalina. Robinson Foundry has an interesting video that discusses this topic.

In the lost wax process, which is often used for the fine arts process, the original sculpture is destroyed in the process of making the mold (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/. Could using 3D scanning allow for creation of accurate models that allow for bronze to be cast without impacting the original sculpture? Companies like Form Capture are already starting to offer services such as these (https://formcapture.com/3d-scanning-art-sculpture/). While the moulds can be used for multiple runs to create more sculptures, over time the nuanced surface textures are destroyed. A recent discussion I had was how the later runs of the Rodin sculptures have lost their surface textures which express the nuances of what the artist had intended. https://news.stanford.edu/2020/07/20/makes-rodin-rodin-stanford-scholar-explains-famed-sculptors-process/


I tried three methods of 3D scanning my plastiline sculpture of my ear and varying results.

 <figcaption>Firstly, I needed a photo of my ear. I took one with my iPhone</figcaption>

 <figcaption>I took a cardboard base I was not using from my kinetic sculpture and used it as my platform to build the ear.</figcaption>

<img src="03_3D_PlastilineEarSide_Stark_July6.jpg" alt="Plastiline ear from side." class="photo">
 <figcaption>Here is the side view of the ear so you can see the relief. This design would be challenting to create using a subtractive method of manufacturing due to its irregular curves and surface texture.</figcaption>

I thought this ear sculpture would test out how well the 3D scan is able to capture hte surface textures and also the topology of hte sculpture. 

For the first two 3D scans, I used the Harvard's lab Revopoint system to scan in my ear sculpture using both the turn table and a manual scan. The results were disappointing. It may be user error, but very little of me was involved in the first automated scan. In the second manual scan, I did need to move the scanner around and perhaps there is a better technique than the one I used.

 <figcaption>I then used the manual way to scan and the results were better, but still disapointing.</figcaption>

 <figcaption>I brought it into PrusaSlicer to see what it would look like. Quite abstract.</figcaption>

 As a third try, I used an app called Polycam on my iPhone and did a scan of my ear sculpture. The first attempt, I missed a place on the back of the ear. However, second attempt turned out an impressive image.

 <figcaption>As an aside: I couldn't help but also take a scan of Clint. Super impressed (and a little creeped out) about how accurate and detailed the scan turned out. I could see something like this being useful, amongst other more practical applications, to be used as a model to sculpt from. Clint would never hold this still for this long.</figcaption>

 <h4>3D Printing: Balloon Dog, Scissors and a Brush</h4>

 Besides creating a 3D models from using various scanners, I also explored a few 3D prints.

 I first tried to print a 3D model from the Printables website. I selected a balloon dog, inspired and popularized by artist, Jeff Koons. You can find the 3D model here: https://www.printables.com/model/406281-balloon-dog. 

 I downloaded the STL file, opened it up in PrusaSlicer and printed it.

  <img src="12_3D_BalloonDogfromPrinter_Stark_July7.jpg" alt="The results of the balloon dog 3D print." class="photo">
 <figcaption>Balloon dog emerges from the printer. It needed the supports to ensure during the print, the head and body did not collapse.</figcaption>

  <img src="13_3D_BalloonDogPrint_Stark_July7.jpg" alt="Balloon dog without supports" class="photo">
 <figcaption>Used my fingers and a clipper to remove the supports. Pretty pleased with the print out! Maybe a bit of light sanding needed. My own balloon dog.</figcaption>


  <img src="15_3D_ScissorsPrusaSlicer_Stark_July7.jpg" alt="Prusa slicer of my one piece scissors." class="photo">
 <figcaption>Next, I decided to print a 3D CAD drawing I created. In this case, the scissors. I started with trying to print the pair of scissors as one piece. I brought it into Prusa Slicer as an stl exported from Autodesk Fusion and turned it into gcode for the printer.</figcaption>

  <img src="14_3D_ScissorsPrintOnePiece_Stark_July6.jpg" alt="Scissors in one piece." class="photo">
 <figcaption>Results of my 3D print of the scissors as one piece.</figcaption>


  <img src="16_3D_PrusaSlicerScissorsSeparate_Stark_July7.jpg" alt="Prusa slicer of the 2 part scissors." class="photo">
 <figcaption>Then I thought it would be cool to print the pair of scissors as 2 pieces and put them together. I tried to be efficient as 3D printing takes some time to put both pieces on the same bed. The challenge I found was that the printer kept getting stuck because when it would go to print the second piece of the scissors, the first part layer would cool too much for the next layer to stick on it well. Based on this learning, I decided to print the two parts separately. </figcaption>

 --- NEED to ADD RESULTS

  <img src="18_3D_BrushPrusaSlicer_Stark_July7.jpg" alt="Brush import into Prusa Slicer." class="photo">
 <figcaption>Next up is the brush I had modified earlier. When I imported it into PrusaSlicer, it appeared standing up. This was when I realized that designing something in CAD to be printed, one may need to consider the best way to print it. Like in the 2D world where you had to consider if your paper was in portrait or landscape mode.</figcaption>

  <img src="19_3D_PrusaSlicerBrush02_Stark_July7.jpg" alt="Orienting the brush for 3D printing." class="photo">
 <figcaption>I used the tools in PrusaSlicer to place it on the print bed. However, because the back of the brush has the protruding rounded handle, it didn't lie perfectly flat. I thought about how something like this would be supported. One one hand, you could have supports, but this will also make the surface texture rougher and need more time to work on after it comes out of the printer. Considerations for the design of something one wants to 3D print.</figcaption>

  <img src="20_3D_PrusaSlicerBrush03_Stark_July7.jpg" alt="Orienting the brush for 3D printing." class="photo">
 <figcaption>Not sure this is the optimal solution, testing it out...</figcaption>

  <img src="21_3D_BrushPrinting_Stark_July6.jpg" alt="Resuls of the 3D print." class="photo">
 <figcaption>In particular, I wanted to print the brush to see how or if the bristles would even print. Clearly they did not. </figcaption>

  <img src="22_3D_BrushPrintTop_Stark_July6.jpg" alt="Printed brush." class="photo">
 <figcaption>The handle turned out well and had a good feel to it as a "prototype".</figcaption>

<img src="23_3D_BrushPrintBottom_Stark_July6.jpg" alt="Back of brush." class="photo">
 <figcaption>Back of the brush. The supports left a rough surface.</figcaption>


Overall, this experience of trying to bring 3D modeled items shows there are considerations in design of objects if one is planning to 3D print them. The more parts of the object need to be suspended, the great the supports and challenges of being able to print it on something like a Prusa printer. Besides altering one's design, one can also use a different 3D printing method such as Form Labs that uses water to support and suspend an object as it is printing. It is a more expensive process, but for different requirements, may be worth it.
