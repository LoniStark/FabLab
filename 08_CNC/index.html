<h4>The Thinking Chair: CNC</h4>
<br>

I got it into my head I want to build a custom press fit chair. This is crazy given the compressed time and the other projects I am trying to iterate. But once it was in my head, I couldn't get it out. So we go on another exploration, against my rational brain...

This idea didn't come from no where. The internet is a dangerous place and the inspiration came from looking at a couple of these sources. Yes, I'm putting the blame for the crazy of idea of building a chair on these influences.

<ul>

</ul>

In particular, Boris Goldberg's design was beautiful and made me look more into the living hinge technique. I had seen some samples lying around the Harvard lab but up until now, I had not the courage to consider trying to do something like this. But give my brain a little victory in some areas and it starts to believe that all is possible again - my body and sleep schedule groan. Here's a great video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSlRusl7UPc. As I continued doing research, I found this great video about how to make Boris Goldberg's chair on a CNC machine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-WIeiTDWaQ.

Here is a great video on the kerfing technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngC5S5vWQ4g.

With some of these ideas, I decided to make this chair personal to me and so I did some research on ergonomics of chairs. Using some of the information I found on these websites, I took my own measurements for the chair.

  <figcaption>Measurements for my personal chair. Given my shorter than average stature, chairs usually feel a little too big for me. This is an opportunityt make a chair that fits me just right.</figcaption>

<img src="02_CNC_ChairBackAngles_Stark_July19.jpg" class="photo" alt="Angles">
  <figcaption>I also wanted this chair to be a place I could think, draw, and read in my art studio, so I do want some angle to it and not have it be a desk-type task chair. It was hard for me to measure what angle I would need tha back to be so instead I looked around the place I am staying at for the summer and picked the chair that I thought moved in that direction as a starting point. Looking at this chair also make me think of the angle of the seat and also whether I would have cushions. While I like the idea of cushions, given this will be in a semi-outdoor part of the art studio, the courtyard space, I was concerned cushions may attract outdoor wild life to nest in it. The preference would be to design a chair that would comfortable to sit in without any cushions. I also found this great reference: https://www.monsiegeamoi.com/blog/en/2020/01/06/the-ideal-angles-for-a-chair/.</figcaption>

<img src="03_CNC_ChairSketches_Stark_July19.jpg" class="photo" alt="Measuring for a personal chair.">
  <figcaption>Based on the research, I tried to sketch out a chair design. I really liked hte curve lines and kerfing technique.</figcaption>


<img src="04_CNC_ChairCADPrototype1_Stark_July20.jpg" class="photo" alt="Measuring for a personal chair.">
  <figcaption>Started to make the CAD versions of the chair with a sketch. First I created a stick figure of the chair with all the measurements I took. Then I overlayed it with a sketch that had the design elements I wanted. I decided to make the front legs assymetrical as I liked how it made the chair look like it was running off or posing, not standing still. Then extruded them into solids. I think I am going to go with a 3/4 inch plywood, double layer for the frame so that I can cut them in smaller pieces and then attach them by offsetting the two version. This will overcome the Shopbot limit of cutting up to 18'x24' wood. I plan to filet the chair frame in different areas, but I will do this later as I find if I do it too early, it gets more challenging to edit major aspects of the design in Fusion.</figcaption>


I have some ideas about a single armrest that has a swing out table in case I want to rest a drawing pad or book on it. However, I had trouble picturing how it would look so I decided to hold off on this and instead start with the core chair prototype.

  <figcaption>First cardboard prototype hot off the laser 2D cutter. I did use a knife to mimic the kerfing to bend the wood. I guess I could have tried using the scoring option as well. It's cool to see this design at 1/4 scale. I learned this approach in my research on how to approach designing a chair. </figcaption>

  <figcaption>Second prototype of the chair. I made the legs shorter and instead of moving the asymmetric leg, I decided to lean more into it. The world already has many symmetric chairs. Perhaps a thinking chair should be one that invite one to challenge the status quo. I did this by extending the wing of the opposing side of the chair that is reminscent of a contrapposto pose.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>To speed up the ideation and design process, I took the previous 3 photos into Adobe Fresco and made adjustments to prototype 2. With different layers, I am able to make adjustments to the lines of the chair and to A/B comparison testing. In this way, I evaluate many more options than if I bring it all the way to cardboard. To make it realistic though, it is good to have a real foundation like prototype #3 to work from. I could do some of this in Fusion but I like the more organic feel of my designs using the process of iterating between real and imaginary.</figcaption>

This week I've thought a lot about chairs. In particular, why they are symmetrical. As I continue to explore my "Thinking Chair" the idea of an asymmetrical design continues to grow in fascination. An aspect I love about asymmetry is that, in this case, you have to look at the entire chair to know what it looks like. One can't just see one leg and know what the other three are. Or see the profile of the chair and know it completely. I think this extends to people as well and this notion I continue to explore around self-complexity. I do think this is a chair that will invite me to think boldly and in interesting ways. There is still much to do to complete this chair. I feel the rush of time with each passing day. On one hand, it's quite a bit of self-imposed pressure. On the other hand, is there not the exhileration, like a firm press a car's acceleration, in rushing to express a vision?

While I need to make the adjustments to the CAD drawings from prototype 2 to get the final prototype before moving to editing the body and wood version, I wanted to try out the idea of my "armrest turn mini-table idea" on my cardboard prototype 2. I had tried to draw this in on the digital version but it was not realistic enough to acertain if it would work with the design. Per the ergonomic measurements I made, this armrest is about 19 cm from the seat

<img src="14_CNC_Prototype2withArmRest_Stark_July22.jpg" class="photo" alt="Armrest on prototype #2.">
  <figcaption>Prototype #2 with armrest for coffee turn writing and reading place. Will port this armrest design to prototype 3 after I am able to make the adjustments in CAD and do another (hopefully final" cardboard sketch cut.</figcaption>

<img src="15_CNC_Prototype3_Stark_July22.jpg" class="photo" alt="Prototype 3">
  <figcaption>Went to the lab and built prototype 3 (chair on right). I had some issues with my CAD drawing so it took longer than I had wanted it to. I feel I've landed on the design and now it is about ensuring mistakes don't get into my CAD drawings and I can scale this up to it's actual size from the 0.25 scale prototypes.</figcaption>

  In terms of how I think I am going to accomplish building a real-life scale version of this within the boundaries of the time we have and the equipment we have in the lab:

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Two back legs</strong>: I think I will use the shaper tool cut the two back legs. In total the height of these parts are almost 100 cm which is 39" and beyond the 18"x24" limit of the Shopbot.</li>
    <li><strong>Front legs and braces</strong>: The shop bot will be able to handle this.</li>
    <li><strong>The seat</strong>: This is the hardest part as I wanted to use the kerfing technique to enable bending of the wood. This does require a CNC machine. I may need to think about how I slice up the whole into pieces smaller than 18"x24" so I can cut it and then put it back together. Or change the design to accomplish this. </li>
</ul>

<img src="16_CNC_Prototype4CAD_Stark_July23.jpg" class="photo" alt="Prototype 4 The Thinking Chair">
  <figcaption>This morning I made all the design modification and corrected the issues from prototype 4. Also changed the back seat angle so it repeats the diagonal flow of the rest of the asymmetrical chair. Also made CAD drawings of the armrest. I modified the design a bit so that the swing out table would be more practical. The plan is to print a final (famous last words) version of this at a quarter scale in cardboard before I proceed with the wood full-size version. Still think it is a little crazy to have such a compressed timeframe, but sometimes it is good just to keep on executing on a vision and not question if something is possible or not. </figcaption>

<img src="17_CNC_Prototype4Tweaks_Stark_July23.jpg" class="photo" alt="Prototype 4 The Thinking Chair">
  <figcaption>This afternoon, I was able to go into the labs and make another cardboard prototype "4" on the laser cutter. Of course as I was looking to cut it, I noticed some issues. Specifically, the narrower leg was missing a notch in the backrest to account for the arm of the chair. I had to adjust for this. I also found working on something bigger required me to zoom in on Fusion 360 closer as there were extraneous artifacts I had to remove which were not apparent at the window zoom level I usually work at. I wanted to a take a photo of the frame before the seat went on as in this view, one sees more of the design decision made on the frame.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>Gluing and clamping on the seat. Doing this process for the fourth time made me reflect on how I was going to accomplish this in at full scale with wood. I thought perhaps a few "press fit" tabs in the seat and back in the leg frames would help me line up the seat and set it in place.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I decided to selectively turn different parts of the chair into a draft CNC cut at full size so I can reflect on if the proportions feel right. They also needed to be parts that fit within the contraints of an 18"x24" Shopbot for now. I started with the front leg.</figcaption>

   <img src="29_CNC_AllFullSizeCuts_Stark_July24.jpg" class="photo" alt="Prototype 4 The Thinking Chair">
  <figcaption>All in, I cut 3 pieces on the CNC. I may cut one of the back legs just to get a feel for the overall height. The most problematic piece will be the chair back and seat. But one step at a time... While a part of me questions whether I will get this done, the other part of me says not to worry about this and instead, "run, run, run...". I can't believe we only have two weeks left of this exploration into digital fabrication.</figcaption>

  <img src="30_CNC_LifeSizePose_Stark_July28.jpg" class="photo" alt="Me Posing with the Chair">
  <figcaption>Given the Harvard lab is a larger space, and just like things in Costco look tiny until you bring them home, I was able to get these full size cuts of my Thinking Chair back to the place I am staying to see how proportionately it fits. Very happy with the measurements I took at the start and how they translated to the designed chair.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>Went to Home Depot for the required plywood. Originally I wanted to use 3/4" plywood, but given the weight and availability of options, decided to get 1/2" plywood instead. Each sheet was cut into 10 pieces of 18"x24" which is max size of the Shopbot in the lab.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>Check out! Back to the labs...</figcaption>

<img src="38_CNC_FirstWoodCut_Stark_Aug2.jpg" class="photo" alt="In wood.">
  <figcaption>Inaugural cut of the first piece of the chair. It took three other "wrong" pieces to get to this point. I needed to choose the "outside/right" option to ensure the notches were actually 24 mm. Also instead of doing a "dog bone" cut, I CAD some 3.18 mm holes with the center at the corner of the notch so that the Shopbot cleared the right amount of wood at the corner to have all the pieces press together. </figcaption>

<img src="39_CNC_WoodafterFirstDay_Stark_Aug1.jpg" class="photo" alt="In wood.">
  <figcaption>It was a long day to cut the pieces of wood so far. I had to adjust the CAD drawings to allow for two sheets of wood, but at different parts of the design so I could glue them together later to form a bigger pieces than what the Shopbot could handle. </figcaption>
