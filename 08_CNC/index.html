<h4>The Thinking Chair: CNC</h4>
<br>

I got it into my head I want to build a custom press fit chair. This is crazy given the compressed time and the other projects I am trying to iterate. But once it was in my head, I couldn't get it out. So we go on another exploration, against my rational brain...

This idea didn't come from no where. The internet is a dangerous place and the inspiration came from looking at a couple of these sources. Yes, I'm putting the blame for the crazy of idea of building a chair on these influences.

In particular, Boris Goldberg's design was beautiful and made me look more into the living hinge technique. I had seen some samples lying around the Harvard lab but up until now, I had not the courage to consider trying to do something like this. But give my brain a little victory in some areas and it starts to believe that all is possible again - my body and sleep schedule groan. Here's a great video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSlRusl7UPc. As I continued doing research, I found this great video about how to make Boris Goldberg's chair on a CNC machine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-WIeiTDWaQ.

Here is a great video on the kerfing technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngC5S5vWQ4g.

With some of these ideas, I decided to make this chair personal to me and so I did some research on ergonomics of chairs. Using some of the information I found on these websites, I took my own measurements for the chair.

  <figcaption>Measurements for my personal chair. Given my shorter than average stature, chairs usually feel a little too big for me. This is an opportunityt make a chair that fits me just right.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I also wanted this chair to be a place I could think, draw, and read in my art studio, so I do want some angle to it and not have it be a desk-type task chair. It was hard for me to measure what angle I would need tha back to be so instead I looked around the place I am staying at for the summer and picked the chair that I thought moved in that direction as a starting point. Looking at this chair also make me think of the angle of the seat and also whether I would have cushions. While I like the idea of cushions, given this will be in a semi-outdoor part of the art studio, the courtyard space, I was concerned cushions may attract outdoor wild life to nest in it. The preference would be to design a chair that would comfortable to sit in without any cushions. I also found this great reference: https://www.monsiegeamoi.com/blog/en/2020/01/06/the-ideal-angles-for-a-chair/.</figcaption>

<img src="03_CNC_ChairSketches_Stark_July19.jpg" class="photo" alt="Measuring for a personal chair.">
  <figcaption>Based on the research, I tried to sketch out a chair design. I really liked hte curve lines and kerfing technique.</figcaption>


<img src="04_CNC_ChairCADPrototype1_Stark_July20.jpg" class="photo" alt="Measuring for a personal chair.">
  <figcaption>Started to make the CAD versions of the chair with a sketch. First I created a stick figure of the chair with all the measurements I took. Then I overlayed it with a sketch that had the design elements I wanted. I decided to make the front legs assymetrical as I liked how it made the chair look like it was running off or posing, not standing still. Then extruded them into solids. I think I am going to go with a 3/4 inch plywood, double layer for the frame so that I can cut them in smaller pieces and then attach them by offsetting the two version. This will overcome the Shopbot limit of cutting up to 18'x24' wood. I plan to filet the chair frame in different areas, but I will do this later as I find if I do it too early, it gets more challenging to edit major aspects of the design in Fusion.</figcaption>


I have some ideas about a single armrest that has a swing out table in case I want to rest a drawing pad or book on it. However, I had trouble picturing how it would look so I decided to hold off on this and instead start with the core chair prototype.
