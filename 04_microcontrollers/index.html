### Microcontroller Programming

Moisture Sensor Experiments

Moisture

- if levels too high – red, solid
- if level too low – red, blinking
- if level is dangerous – yellow, solid

x levels of moisture
compare to plant type
result from calculation
dispense appropriate water

Dry to Too Wet

Red, solid -> yellow, solid -> green solid,

PHOTO of hook up

I started with the basic soil moisture Arduino code example. 


Didn't have an LCD monitor so decided I would code based on colored lights

Dry to too wet

Red, solid -> yellow, solid -> green solid -> yellow, blinking -> Red, blinking


Given my coffee experiment - seems go from 0 (dry) to totally wet (in my coffee) ~1000

For now, I will set my ranges as constants and go with integers vs floats as 100 increments of moisture is well enough for even the pickiest of plants I would imagine. In future could see a plant database calibrated by experts as well as the potential size of the plant to determine not only when a plant needs water but howmuch to dispense. 


I adjusted the code so instead of printing the value detected, I printed out: value, color and blick or not.


Here is the code:

/*  Soil Moisture Traffic Light
    This sketch was written starting from examples from SparkFun Electronics and the Arduino Projects Book. 
    Loni Stark
    July 1, 2023

    Checks soil moisture levels and alerts plant parent with possible 5 values:
    - too dry: red solid light
    - dry warning: red blink light
    - green: plant is at right moisture
    - wet warning: yellow blinking light
    - too wet: yellow solid light

*/

int val = 0; //value for storing moisture value 
int soilPin = A0;//Declare a variable for the soil moisture sensor 
int soilPower = 7;//Variable for Soil moisture Power
int lightColor = 1; //Variable for light color: RED = 0, YELLOW = 1, GREEN = 2;
int blink= 0; // Variable for if light will blink. blink = 1, no blink = 0

const int TOO_DRY = 200; //value equal or below is considered too dry
const int WARN_DRY = 300; //value less than or above TOO_DRY is considered a dry warning
const int WARN_WET = 600; //value greater than or below TOO_WET is considered a wet warning
const int TOO_WET = 700; //value equal or greater than is considered too wet. 
const int RED = 0;
const int GREEN = 1;
const int YELLOW = 2;
const int ERROR = -1;


//Rather than powering the sensor through the 3.3V or 5V pins, the digital pin 7 will
//be used to power hte sensor. This will prevent corrosion of the sensor as it is in soil. 
//The 3.3V power output will be used to power the red, yellow and green lights.

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(9600);   // open serial over USB

  pinMode(soilPower, OUTPUT);//Set D7 as an OUTPUT
  digitalWrite(soilPower, LOW);//Set to LOW so no power is flowing through the sensor
}

void loop() 
{

Serial.println("===SOIL CONDITION====");

Serial.print("Soil Moisture = ");    
//get soil moisture value from the function below and print it
Serial.println(readSoil());

Serial.print("Light Color = "); 
//set color indicator state for soil moisture.
Serial.println(setLightColor());

Serial.print("Light Blink = "); 
//set blink indicator state for soil moisture.
Serial.println(setLightBlink());

Serial.println(" ");

//This 2 second timefrme is used so you can test the sensor and see it change in real-time.
//For in-plant applications, you will want to take readings much less frequently.
delay(2000);//take a reading every second
}
//This is a function used to get the soil moisture content
int readSoil()
{

    digitalWrite(soilPower, HIGH);//turn D7 "On"
    delay(10);//wait 10 milliseconds 
    val = analogRead(soilPin);//Read the SIG value form sensor 
    digitalWrite(soilPower, LOW);//turn D7 "Off"
    return val;//send current moisture value
}

int setLightBlink () {
  //function to set the light color based on soilPin value
   if (val <= TOO_DRY){
      blink = 0;
   }
    else if (val <= WARN_DRY){
      blink = 1;
    }

    else if (val <= WARN_WET){
      blink = 0;
    }

    else if (val > WARN_WET){
      blink = 1;
    }

    else if (val > TOO_WET){
      blink = 0;
    }

    else{
      blink = ERROR;
    }


    return blink;
}

int setLightColor () {
  //function to set the light color based on soilPin value
   if (val <= TOO_DRY){
      lightColor = RED;
   }
    else if (val <= WARN_DRY){
      lightColor = RED;
    }

    else if (val <= WARN_WET){
      lightColor = GREEN;
    }

    else if (val > WARN_WET){
      lightColor = YELLOW;
    }

    else if (val > TOO_WET){
      lightColor = YELLOW;
    }
    
    else {
      lightColor = ERROR;
    }
    return lightColor;
}


Next, I built the circuit and played with the code for the Spaceship Interface to understand how outputs worked so that I could hook up the input from the soil moisture monitor to the output of red, yellow and green LEDs with the state of solid or blinking light to signal each of the states of a plant. I didn't have all the right resisters for the project. 

I added another variable to save the state of the light color that was turned on and then turn it off if the blink variable was on (equal to 1). In order to test this out, I had to change the constant values for the different moisture levels in order for there to be enough of a range for the blinking to occur. Otherwise, it was challenging to get the blinking to work even if the "blink" flag was on based on the println results.

const int TOO_DRY = 50; //value equal or below is considered too dry
const int WARN_DRY = 450; //value less than or above TOO_DRY is considered a dry warning
const int WARN_WET = 460; //value greater than or below TOO_WET is considered a wet warning
const int TOO_WET = 900; //value equal or greater than is considered too wet. 
const int RED = 0;
const int GREEN = 1;
const int YELLOW = 2;
const int ERROR = -1;

ADD IN THE VIDEO TEST

Next up is using the Love-O-Meter example to see how I can get the temperature sensor hooked up to my plant care monitor. After going through the example, I modified it to be additive to the circuit that I was building. Instead of connecting the input from the temperature sensor to "A0", I used the next port over, "A1". In addition, unlike the moisture sensor which I wanted to minimize reads to prevent corrosion of the sensor device, I put the sensor before the button so the temperature sensor is always on and sending inputs. I also put in code to warn of too hot or too cold temperatures. I can see how an LCD screen or some other more flexible output device rather than LED lights can come in handy here. Instead of adding another light, I am just going to look at the serial output and later on, hook up a richer output device.

I included a function:

int readTemp()
{
    val = analogRead(tempPin);//Read the SIG value from temp sensor 
    return val;//send current temp value
}

The readings I got from it was 1023. I could not find the part information so I will look into it when I have access to the lab again. I am realizing just like a bench for electricity, I almost need one for moisture and temperature to check on the validity of the sensors and my set up! For now I will comment out the call to it in the loop() function.




Need to learn about the Arduino IoT Cloud...
