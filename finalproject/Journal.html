#### Final Project: The Trials, Tribulations and Triumph

<br>

##### June 22, 2023.

<div class="main">

After discussing the different ideas with others, I decided unless I came up with a better idea in the next week, I would spend my time on Pet Sitter and pursue my Cat's Cradle project as a way to learn more about robotic arms. The Pet Sitter is the front-runner because even though there are other solutions out there, there is a lot of range for the project from totally feasible to the ability to take the concept to new heights. There is the opportunity to connect different sensors, deploy different actions and evolve design/useability aspects of set up and monitoring. There could also be a specific personal and niche aspect of the problem which I could extend to in order to make it a unique solution.<br>
<br>

The Sky Roof Transformer would be super cool to bring to reality, but given the state of technology for both glass panels that turns opaque or lights up, I will most probably need to purchase them and perhaps hook them up. As a result, the central essence of this project loses the essence of the digital fabricaton initaitive. I still love the idea of having a Sky Roof Transformer and perhaps what I learn over the course of the 7 weeks will arm me to build this if it is not commercially available in the manner I conceive. <br>

For today, I'd like to chip away at the Pet Sitter project by researching online for resources. It is also a means to feel like I am making some progress after a two hour lab wrestling with Autodesk Fusion 360; it will not have the last word!<br>

Based on my research, here are a few videos which also provided great resources and ideas of what I may need for this project. I specifically searched for video using the Arduino system based on a reference that Bobby, one of the TAs made:
