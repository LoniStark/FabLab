#### Final Project: The Trials, Tribulations and Triumph

<br>

##### June 22, 2023.

<div class="main">

After discussing the different ideas with others, I decided unless I came up with a better idea in the next week, I would spend my time on Pet Sitter and pursue my Cat's Cradle project as a way to learn more about robotic arms. The Pet Sitter is the front-runner because even though there are other solutions out there, there is a lot of range for the project from totally feasible to the ability to take the concept to new heights. There is the opportunity to connect different sensors, deploy different actions and evolve design/useability aspects of set up and monitoring. There could also be a specific personal and niche aspect of the problem which I could extend to in order to make it a unique solution.<br>
<br>

The Sky Roof Transformer would be super cool to bring to reality, but given the state of technology for both glass panels that turns opaque or lights up, I will most probably need to purchase them and perhaps hook them up. As a result, the central essence of this project loses the essence of the digital fabricaton initaitive. I still love the idea of having a Sky Roof Transformer and perhaps what I learn over the course of the 7 weeks will arm me to build this if it is not commercially available in the manner I conceive. <br>

For today, I'd like to chip away at the Pet Sitter project by researching online for resources. It is also a means to feel like I am making some progress after a two hour lab wrestling with Autodesk Fusion 360; it will not have the last word!<br>

Based on my research, here are a few videos which also provided great resources and ideas of what I may need for this project. I specifically searched for video using the Arduino system based on a reference that Bobby, one of the TAs made:

Last night, as I was falling asleep with various fragments of what I read or watched squirling in my head, an idea came to me. All the automation of home irrigation systems was about efficiency and solving the problem of going on vacation. But a hypothesis I have is that people don't just have houseplants to be efficient, it is also for fun and the joy of taking care of something else. 

Novel idea - plants not just automation but nurturing. Can you still while travelling - garden virtually?

Indoor plants have been shown to improve mental wellness and environmental quality. This home plant oasis will enable people to have more house plants in their home by enabling easy monitoring, 

IoT Sensors for Plants and Water

For each of the IoT sensors I needed to ensure it as equiped with the necessary input sensors and also the way to communicate with the central home garden hub. For this, an ESP32-C3 board is used. 

Set up this board using these instructions:
https://how2electronics.com/getting-started-with-seeed-xiao-esp32-c3-board/


I used it to ensure I had the dev environment set up properly.


Sensors - using current ot measure resistance
- challenge is moisture but also fertilizer. Also corrosion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFQaFnqpOtQ&t=2s

- more or less water, discharge/charge will impact.

Set up an analog read in pin D0 (also A0).

Totally dry readings:
- dry in air: 3165, 3310, 3319, 3311
- submerged into water: 1277,1311, 1294

Translate this moisture into percentage using map(); function.
